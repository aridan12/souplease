			<h1 class="recipe-title">Lentil Soup Recipe</h1>
			<div class="head-recipe">
				<img src="..\images\slideshow\soups\lentil.jpg" alt="lentil_soup_recipe">
			</div>
			<div class="body-recipe">
				<div class="title-recipe-text">Ingredients</div>
				<div class="desc-recipe">
				¼ cup extra virgin olive oil<br>
				1 medium yellow or white onion, chopped<br>
				2 carrots, peeled and chopped<br>
				4 garlic cloves, pressed or minced<br>
				2 teaspoons ground cumin<br>
				1 teaspoon curry powder<br>
				½ teaspoon dried thyme<br>
				1 large can (28 ounces) diced tomatoes, lightly drained<br>
				1 cup brown or green lentils, picked over and rinsed<br>
				4 cups vegetable broth<br>
				2 cups water<br>
				1 teaspoon salt, more to taste<br>
				Pinch of red pepper flakes<br>
				Freshly ground black pepper, to taste<br>
				1 cup chopped fresh collard greens or kale, tough ribs removed<br>
				1 to 2 tablespoons lemon juice (½ to 1 medium lemon), to taste.<br><br>
				</div>
				<div class="title-recipe-text">Preparation</div>
				<div class="desc-recipe">
				Warm the olive oil in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium heat. One-fourth cup olive oil may seem like a lot, but it adds a lovely richness and heartiness to this nutritious soup.<br>
				Once the oil is shimmering, add the chopped onion and carrot and cook, stirring often, until the onion has softened and is turning translucent, about 5 minutes.<br>
				Add the garlic, cumin, curry powder and thyme. Cook until fragrant while stirring constantly, about 30 seconds. Pour in the drained diced tomatoes and cook for a few more minutes, stirring often, in order to enhance their flavor.<br>
				Pour in the lentils, broth and the water. Add 1 teaspoon salt and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Season generously with freshly ground black pepper. Raise heat and bring the mixture to a boil, then partially cover the pot and reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the lentils are tender but still hold their shape.<br>
				Transfer 2 cups of the soup to a blender. Securely fasten the lid, protect your hand from steam with a tea towel placed over the lid, and purée the soup until smooth. Pour the puréed soup back into the pot. (Or, use an immersion blender to blend a portion of the soup.)<br>
				Add the chopped greens and cook for 5 more minutes, or until the greens have softened to your liking. Remove the pot from the heat and stir in 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. Taste and season with more salt, pepper and/or lemon juice until the flavors really sing. For spicier soup, add another pinch or two of red pepper flakes.<br>
				Serve while hot. Leftovers will keep well for about 4 days in the refrigerator, or can be frozen for several months (just defrost before serving).<br>
